# Roadmap {.title .is-2}

## Release in August 2026 {.title .is-3}

Matching the release schedule of the underlying Veilid framework, we aim for the first stable, public Coagulate release in the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and on f-droid in August 2026.

## Open Beta in early 2026 {.title .is-3}

Don't want to wait until August 2026?
As a successor to our current closed testing phase, we aim for an open testing phase to start in early 2026.
Users will be able to onboard themselves but might still face instabilities or braking changes.

## Current Work Packages {.title .is-3}

Until our first stable release in August 2026, we are focusing on the following work packages.
Keep in mind, all feature development is done by folks volunteering their time to the project without requiring financial compensation.
Also, depending on the user feedback we get, we might decide to shift focus along the way and update the work packages below accordingly.

### Pilot Group UX Study {.title .is-4}
- Study setup focused on initial onboarding
- Eight one-on-one user interviews
- Self-reported written feedback from 30 users
- Implementing at least the top three improvements

### Introductions {.title .is-4}
- Targeted investigation of existing basic peer introduction feature with small cohort
- Key component to help users connect based on transitive trust
- Implement smarter introduction suggestions

### Dashboard {.title .is-4}

## Improvements Beyond {.title .is-3}

These are our ideas to continuously improve Coagulate after our first public release:
- Downloadable maps for extended offline map support, improved privacy, and reduced operational cost
- Appreciation for financial contributions, e.g. Signal like profile picture badge
- Fine grained notification settings, allowing users to configure per circle, contact, or location which things they want to be notified about
- Translation into more languages like Spanish, German, and French
- Accessibility improvements like consistent UI scaling, high contrast mode, screen reader compatibility and use of platform accessibility APIs
- Share tags with circles to indicate interests, topics, etc.
- Batch introductions for folks wo already know each other
- Hosted map tiles and geocoding privacy proxy via Veilid
