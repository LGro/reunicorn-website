1. What information do we collect?

Reunicorn collects no information from you. Reunicorn is designed to not collect your information and to operate in an encrypted, distributed manner, which means we cannot access your information even if we wanted to (which we don’t). Any information you enter into Reunicorn on your device is inaccessible to us.

We only collects personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you request an invitation to the beta version of the application. This will only be the contact information necessary for us to send you an invitation. This process is managed by the Apple App Store and the we only retain this information long enough to provide it to the Apple App Store to generate an invitation.

2. How do we process your information?

We don’t. Reunicorn does not collect your information, nor are we able to collect it. Administration of, improvements to, and changes to the Reunicorn application will be made without any processing of personal information. We will never ask you for personal, sensitive, or financial information.

If you provide any information to us at devs(at)reunicorn.app or directly via postal mail, we will only process that information to answer your questions or attempt to support your issues, with two major exceptions:

    Legal Obligations. We may process information sent to us via email, our website, or via postal mail where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
    Vital Interests. We may process information sent to us via email, our website, or via postal mail where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

3. What legal bases do we rely on to process your information?

Reunicorn does not process any personal information. Because we cannot access information entered into Reunicorn in any way, shape, or form, we do not process your information.

As for information sent to us via email, postal mail, or through our website, we only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e.,legal obligations) to do so under applicable law, to comply with laws, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.

If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. Reunicorn does not collect or process personal information. For any information that is sent directly to us, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

    Consent. We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. This is generally limited to contacting us and requesting an invite code to the beta version of the application, however, we do not store this information. Apple, through the App Store, will manage the invitation process. Your contact information cannot be linked to your Reunicorn account by us. You can withdraw your consent to Apple at any time.
    Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
    Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.

Reunicorn does not collect or process personal information. For any information that is sent directly to us, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). This is generally limited to contacting us and requesting an invite code to the beta version of the application. Apple, through the App Store, will manage the invitation process. Your contact information cannot be linked to your Reunicorn account by us. You can withdraw your consent to Apple at any time.

    In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
    If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
    For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
    If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
    For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
    If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
    If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
    If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
    If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
    If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
    If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

4. When and with whom do we share your personal information?

In no way, shape, or form do we ever share your personal information. We cannot share what we do not retain, or what we cannot access.

    Business Transfers. In the event of any merger, sale, or acquisition of any portion of Reunicorn, we will provide updates on our website or through application updates for the Reunicorn application through the App Store. Because we do not collect any personal information, we have no other methods to provide this information to you.

5. How long do we keep your information?

We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law. However, in most cases, we are incapable of retaining information because we do not collect it.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law. Reunicorn will retain a local copy of your information (accessible only to your device and the people you directly share information with) for as long as you utilize the application. In future iterations of the application, there will be a “delete messages after a certain period of time” functionality, but for the beta testing proof-of-concept, this functionality has not been introduced.

6. How do we keep your information safe?

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that any unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from Reunicorn is at your own risk. You should only access Reunicorn within a secure environment. If you lose access to your device, we cannot access or delete information stored there.

7. Do we collect information from minors?

We do not collect information from or market to anyone. If you suspect that someone underage is violating the Apple App Store terms of service by downloading Reunicorn, please contact Apple at Support.Apple.com.

8. What are your privacy rights?

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.

However, due to the unique nature of Reunicorn, the only information available is stored locally on the user’s device and is inaccessible by us. Reunicorn does not collect or process any personal information. If a user wishes to exercise their data rights, they may copy any data within the Reunicorn application and export it themselves, or delete the application from their device. We have no access to any user’s data.

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.
Account Information

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:

    Log in to your account settings and update your user account.
    Delete the application from your device.

Upon your decision to delete the application from your device, it will no longer be able to be accessed by anyone, including the creators of the application. Any data still in existence will be encrypted, distributed, and inaccessible by any party.

However, we may retain some information that is sent directly to the us via email, our website, or via post mail in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at devs(at)reunicorn.app.
9. Controls for Do-Not-track Features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. Reunicorn is compliant with this technology because we do not monitor, track, collect, or process any information.
