# Contribute {.title .is-2}

Reunicorn is an open community project to which you can start contributing today.
And you do not need to be a programmer for that.

> Mission: Help people to discover opportunities for meeting up and get in contact with others that matter to them.

We use this mission statement as a reference to help prioritize potential features and feedback.


## Feedback {.title .is-3}

While using Reunicorn, you noticed something that you would like to share?
Do you have suggestions for improvement, or did you find an unintuitive aspect?
Please write us about your impression and what you would wish to have changed via e-mail at feedback|at|reunicorn.app, or create an [issue](https://github.com/LGro/reunicorn/issues/new) in case you are familiar with GitHub.


## Translation {.title .is-3}

You are fluent in another language aside from English or German and would like to help translate Reunicorn?
We are looking for translation maintainers that take responsibility for creating and keeping new language translations up-to-date as Reunicorn evolves.
If you want to help with bringing Reunicorn to an even wider audience, please reach out via e-mail to feedback|at|reunicorn.app


## Documentation {.title .is-3}

Both for the documentation aimed at developers in the [app repository](https://github.com/LGro/reunicorn), as well as for the [website repository](https://github.com/LGro/reunicorn/issues/new), we need a hand.
You can help add alternatives and how Reunicorn is different, or sharpen the current description as well as elaborate on our plans for the future.


## Development {.title .is-3}

You are interested in developing with Dart and Flutter, or curious what other aspects are relevant for developing a mobile cross-platform app?
Then have a look at the Reunicorn [repository on GitHub.com](https://github.com/LGro/reunicorn).
Tasks that are especially suitable for new contributors are marked ["good first issue"](https://github.com/LGro/reunicorn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
More generally, you can also have a look at where we state ["help wanted"](https://github.com/LGro/reunicorn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
