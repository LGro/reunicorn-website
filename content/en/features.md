You can [connect with others](#connect-with-others) to then [share contact details and locations](#share-with-contacts) with them, see your [contacts on a map](#contacts-on-a-map), with strong [security & privacy](#security--privacy) throughout.

## Connect with Others {.title .is-3}

Before you can share with others, there are different ways to get into contact.

### Direct Invites via Secret Link or QR Code {.title .is-4}

If you have an existing channel of trusted communication, an encrypted messenger like Signal and others, you can send someone a personal, secret invite link.

### Profile Link based Invites {.title .is-4}

You can advertise to others who may or may not have Coagulate yet that you are on Coagulate by adding a public profile link to your social media profiles, e-mails signature, or where ever you like.
With that profile link, others can create an invitation for you to share with them on Coagulate, which they need to send you via an established communication channel.

### Shared Contacts Discovery {.title .is-4}

You can usually find out from what your contacts share with you, whether any two of your contacts are also connected via Coagulate.
For details on how this works in a privacy preserving way, see the corresponding section on our [cryptography](cryptography#shared-contact-discovery) page.

### Introducing Contacts {.title .is-4}

Any two contacts that have not indicated to you that they know each other, can be introduced to each other.
You can add an optional introduction message to let the two introduced contacts know why you wanted them to get into contact.
When you receive an introduction proposal, you can accept or decline the introduction.

### Connected Community Invites {.title .is-4}

Upon request, there is an option for existing communities to onboard their members to Coagulate already connected, omitting the necessity of individual connections via any of the above mentioned ways.
For each community member a personal invitation link is generated, which upon use connects them to any other invitation links from the same batch.

## Share with Contacts {.title .is-3}

Once connected with others you can share information with them, privately and securely.

### Contact Details

You can share the following contact details with others:
- Names
- Phone numbers
- E-mail addresses
- Residential addresses
- Social network user names
- Websites
- Organization membership incl. roles
- Dates like your birthday or anniversaries

### Temporary (Future) Locations

When you (plan to) visit a location, you can schedule a location between a start and end date, or check-in for a chosen duration at your current location.
There is no live location sharing for now.

### Circles Based Sharing

You can add contacts to any number of circles to group them.
When you share contact details or locations with a circle, all contacts in that circle receive the shared information.
Contacts receive the combination of information that is available via all of the circles they are part of.

## Contacts on a Map {.title .is-3}

All your as well as your contacts' locations are visible on one integrated map;
Empowering you to see who you can meet where.

## Security & Privacy {.title .is-3}

All shared information is end-to-end encrypted, only for your contacts to see.
Your connections to others are not observable to outside parties.
